# C-Generator

This python program generates small random C-programs containing fundamental program  
constructs such as simple statements, if-statements, switch cases, function calls,  
loops, nested loops and recursion.  
The generated programs are syntactically correct but they don't charge for anything useful.  
The generated elements can be individually adapted by commenting out the corresponding functions.  


##Usage
`python c_generator.py [count_generated] [save_directory] [program_name]`

count_generated: Amount of programs to generate (default: 1)  
save_directory: The directory to save generated programs (default: .)  
program_name: The name of the generated programs (default: program)
